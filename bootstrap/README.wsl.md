# Bootstrap your Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) system

Full WSL Documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/ .

WSL is a feature of Windows 10 introduced in the Anniversary Update in 2016 and improved since.
It allows you to install different Linux distros to run under Windows
with bidirectional access to file systems and ability to run processes cross-platform.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux for more info.


## Installation of WSL 2

See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10 for up-to-date manual steps.

You can also copy and paste the following in a PowerShell (Administrator) on Windows 1903+:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force;
[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072;
$Script = ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ysoftwareab/yplatform/bin/windows-install-wsl.ps1'))
Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock ([scriptblock]::Create($Script))
Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock ([scriptblock]::Create($Script)) -ArgumentList
```

And install Ubuntu 20.04 distro:

```powershell
$DistroId = "Ubuntu-20.04"

Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force;
[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072;
$Script = ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ysoftwareab/yplatform/bin/windows-install-wsl-app.ps1'))
Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock ([scriptblock]::Create($Script)) -ArgumentList $DistroId
```

From here on, start Ubuntu and continue the [bootstrapping](README.md) procedure as normal.


## WSL for Visual Studio Code (vscode)

`vscode` has extensions that allows you to run the editor in Windows and connect to your WSL installation:

* Download and install `vscode` for Windows
* Install [the "Remote Development" extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)
* Install [the "Remote - WSL" extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl)

To start a WSL version of `vscode`, just type `code .` in your project folder from a bash terminal.
The terminal in the editor will be a bash-terminal instead of a powershell terminal.


## Random notes

If you are having permission issues, or can't set any permissions at all, you might need to run
`wsl sudo cp priv/wsl.conf /etc/wsl.conf` (or similar, mind the uid=1000 and gid=1000).
